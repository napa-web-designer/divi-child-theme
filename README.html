<h1>Divi Child Theme Instructions</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Child Theme created by David Tierney found at <a href="http://designsbytierney.com"><strong>http://designsbytierney.com</strong></a></li>
        
    <li>This is a child theme for the Divi WordPress theme made by <a href="http://www.elegantthemes.com/"><strong>Elegant Themes</strong></a>.</li>
    <li>Created March 5, 2015</li>
    <li>There is a post about this child theme here: <a target="_blank" href="http://designsbytierney.com/2015/03/divi-child-theme-customized-footer-credits"><strong>about Divi child theme</strong></a></li>
</ul>  

<h2>Instructions Intro</h2>
<p>This child theme contains three files:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>footer.php</strong> - replace the footer credits with a copyright notice for the current year and the Site Title, rather than for Elegant Themes and WordPress.  The footer.php was copied and edited from Divi theme version 2.3.1.</li>
    <li><strong>screenshot.png</strong> - required - provides an image that represents this theme. Can be seen in the WordPress admin Theme panel for this theme.</li>
    <li><strong>style.css</strong> - required - allows for you to add custom css.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use this child theme as it is.  Just upload the zip file from within your admin panel at Appearance>Themes as a new theme and activate it. However the following will customize it cosmetically for your own use.</p>

<p>In order to make these edits, you can either extract the zip file on your computer, edit the contents, then re-zip the files up before uploading the zip file from your WordPress Theme admin panel as a new theme.  Or you can upload this zip file as a new theme file and then go to Appearance>Editor to edit the CSS file.  You would need to use an FTP client to replace the screenshot.png image, or you could replace it via a File Manager accessed through your hosting account interface.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Replace the screenshot.png with your own image to act as a theme image as will be displayed in the Theme panel of your WordPress admin.</p>

<p>Edit the Theme Name in style.css on line 2 to replace “Divi Child Theme” with your own custom name, such as the name of your website.  This will become the name of your theme as presented in the Theme panel of your WordPress admin.</p>

<p>Add your custom CSS to style.css starting at line 15.  You can do this via your WordPress admin at Appearance>Editor.</p>

<p>If you extract the zip file before uploading, change the name of the theme folder to match something you want for your theme, again perhaps the name of your website.  Otherwise you could use an FTP client or a hosting File Manager to change the name after it is uploaded.  This will show for anyone looking at the code of your website, as the theme folder name is part of file structure of where your files are located.</p>

<h2>Bonus for Front-end Designers and/or Developers</h2>

<p>To add a credit to yourself as the designer or developer of the website, you just need to un-comment the commented out code on line 46 before the closing paragraph tag; and edit / customize that part within the comments with your own link title tag, your own URL and your own link text.</p>
